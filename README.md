# Matrix-Style ASCII Art Webcam in C#

This **C#** project captures your webcam stream and transforms it into a **Matrix-style ASCII art** video directly in your console. Experience the retro vibes of the iconic falling green characters, but with a live feed from your webcam! üé•‚û°Ô∏èüíª

## Features
- **Real-time webcam feed** rendered as ASCII art.
- Inspired by the **Matrix movie aesthetic**, with ASCII characters cascading in console view.
- Uses a scalable approach for resizing and converting frames, ensuring smooth performance.

## How It Works

1. The program captures frames from your webcam in real-time using the **Emgu.CV** library.
2. Each frame is resized and processed to reduce its resolution for console display.
3. Brightness levels of pixels are mapped to a predefined set of ASCII characters to mimic the Matrix's visual style.
4. The output is displayed in the console, continuously updating for a live effect.

## Requirements

- **Emgu.CV** (a .NET wrapper for OpenCV).
- **.NET Framework** or **.NET Core SDK**.

Install Emgu.CV via NuGet:
```bash
Install-Package Emgu.CV
